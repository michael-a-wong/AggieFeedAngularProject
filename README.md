# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application


## Overview
For this application I used the Open Weather API to get data from a selected city and display the 
data in a vertical stream view based on AggieFeed. 

The application transforms the data received from the API into an AggieFeed Activity and uses
Angular JS to display the information. 

## My code
I based the environment off of the AngularJS tutorial. 

My code is located under /AggieFeedAngularProject/app

The files that I wrote are: 
-index.html
-feed.html
-citySearch.html
-script.js

## How to run

type 
```
git clone git@github.com:michael-a-wong/AggieFeedAngularProject.git
```

then 

    npm start

finally go to 
    http://localhost:8000


To get data, type in a city name and then press 'Weather'. The city data will appear on the right. The default city is Davis.
